# Donations-website
  This project consists of a web application for donations for students using Java Spring and React made for my Bachelor's degree exam. The goal of the  application is to create a community of good people who help each other and to give hope for the  less fortunate students so they can achieve their dreams and contribute to the community  afterwards.<br> 
  This web application is practical and friendly to use. Unlike other applications of this kind,  this one has a targeted group of interest and a easy way to connect the people that are using it.<br>
  By working on this project, I developed my skills on all application's levels. I learned the basics about React, I learned the benefits of Spring boot and Spring frameworks like Spring Security.<br>
